# Autonomous Earth-observing agents
A framework to validate autonomous coordination algorithms for teams of agents in a common observable environment. Build and run with (requires SFML and a C++11 compiler with native OpenMP support):

    $ cd prot-3-gasv2
    $ mkdir build -p && cd build  
    $ cmake ..              # Prepares build environment.
    $ make -j3              # Builds.
    $ ../bin/prot-3         # Runs the sandbox.
